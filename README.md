# Data Mining (ML Project)

* The aim of the project was to segregate tweets into 3 categories - hate speech, offensive and neither
* Data pre-processing like tokenization, stemming, parsing and normalizing was done before feature extraction
* Features like tokens, character length of tokens, count of words in a tweet, counts of URL's, mentions and hashtags, sentiment - positive, negative, neutral, compound were extracted
* Extracted features were fed into 2 models - Decision Tree and Logistic Regression 
* Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1-score tests were conducted for evaluation of the models
